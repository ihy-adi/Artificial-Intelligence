**# Artificial-Intelligence**

This is a rep where I save all my codes that I make in my Artificial Intelligence course.

For minimax, I took help from: https://github.com/vineetjoshi253/TicTacToe-MiniMax

Question for Graph colouring:
A map of Australia is given, showing each of its states and territories. The task is to colour each
region either red, green, or blue in such a way that no neighbouring regions have the same colour
using the constraints satisfaction problem.
Use the following functions:
1. Minimum-remaining-values (MRV) heuristic
2. Least-constraining-value
